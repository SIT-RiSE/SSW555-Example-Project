    <h2>Your SSW555 Starter Pack</h2>
    <p>Pick one standalone app to launch your project. Each module already lives in its own folder, so you can remove the rest without breaking anything.</p>
    <p class="hero-reminder"><strong>Reminder:</strong> This isn’t a bundled multi-function platform. Choose one module, plug it into your work, then delete the extras from <code>templates/apps/</code> and the matching routes in <code>app.py</code>.</p>

<div class="project-info">
    <h3>Why everything is split up</h3>
    <p>Each app ships in its own folder (<code>templates/apps/&lt;app-name&gt;</code>) with shared layout assets kept in <code>templates/base.html</code> and <code>static/css</code>.</p>
    <p>Removing a module is as simple as deleting its template folder and any related database models or routes. Nothing else depends on it.</p>
    <p>Use this structure as a teaching tool or a lightweight launchpad for SSW555 deliverables.</p>
